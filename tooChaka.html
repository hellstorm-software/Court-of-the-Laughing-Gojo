The Carcharodons, also referred to as Carcharodons Astra in High Gothic and sometimes as the "Space Sharks" in Low Gothic, is a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter of uncertain origins. It is rumored to either be an ancient Chapter from the Second Founding or a relatively new one formed during the 23rd Founding.

Considered a potential Successor Chapter of the Raven Guard, this connection is not definitively established. The Carcharodons played a significant role in the later phases of the Badab War, emerging from the void to exact vengeance on those they perceived as traitors to the Imperium of Man and the Emperor.

Historically, the Carcharodons have been a fleet-based Chapter, adhering to the less common Nomad-Predation pattern instead of the more frequently seen Crusading pattern adopted by many other mobile Space Marine Chapters.

As a reward for their involvement in the Badab War, and with the implicit consent of the Fire Hawks—who took control of the Mantis Warriors' territory in the Endymion Cluster—the Carcharodons were allowed to recruit from the promising Feral and Feudal Worlds within the Maelstrom Zone.

After raiding the hidden armories and bases of the Mantis Warriors, the Carcharodons departed the Ultima Segmentum to continue their solitary campaign. Since the formation of the Great Rift and the onset of the Era Indomitus, they have been granted control over the former homeworld of the Mantis Warriors, Ootheca.

There is speculation that the Carcharodons and Space Sharks may actually be the same Chapter, with "Carcharodons" being a translation of their name into High Gothic as "Carcharodons Astra."

The exact founding of this Space Marine Chapter is obscured by the passage of time, with Imperial and Chapter records stating that the Carcharodons have served the "Void Father" (the Emperor) for ten thousand years. This alone does not fully explain their unique status, as their enigmatic reputation has only intensified with each violent action and surprise assault.

Now, the name Carcharodons is emblematic of the cold, dark void and the predatory entities that dwell within it. This Chapter of Astartes has developed a shadowy and bloody legacy, particularly in the aftermath of the Badab War.

Emerging from the depths of space as strangers to both allies and enemies, the Carcharodons aligned with the Loyalists against those who would challenge the Imperium.

The origins of this infamous Chapter are challenging to trace within Imperial archives, as the Carcharodons have left no records of their recent activities. They do not appear in publicly available Imperial documentation and lack officially recorded battle honors. Additionally, they are frequently confused with other lesser-known Chapters with similar names and symbols, such as "Void Reapers" and "Blood Sharks."

However, classified records within the Inquisition may provide insight into this Chapter's true origins. The oldest of these documents on the Imperium's wars may be found in the Mythos Angelica Mortis, authored by the savant-scribes of the Secretariat Militum of Terra in the late 35th Millennium.

Notable Campaigns
Solar Rebellions (circa M32)
In the western reaches of the Segmentum Solar, a series of Chaos Cult uprisings orchestrated by Chaos Space Marine warbands, including factions from the Iron Warriors, Night Lords, and World Eaters, caused widespread chaos, overwhelming planetary governments in a year marked by bloodshed and anarchy. As entire sectors teetered on the brink of collapse, a coalition of Adeptus Astartes surged from the depths of space to launch a decisive and sudden assault on the uprising’s command structure. While many Loyalist Space Marines made the ultimate sacrifice, the leaders of the Traitor factions were defeated, causing the uprising to splinter into numerous localized rebellions swiftly quashed by Imperial forces. Inquisitorial investigations suggest that several Chapters, including the Carcharodons, Minotaurs, Death Eagles, and Angels of Absolution, were involved. However, inconsistencies related to their estimated founding and deployment timelines have led to skepticism regarding these claims, leaving the event steeped in speculation.

Astropath Wars (888.M32)
The specifics of this conflict are largely unknown, but its name implies the involvement of astropaths in some capacity.

Pentarchy of Blood (860-940.M33)
During the tumultuous period known as the War of the False Primarch, which plunged the Segmentum Pacificus into chaos, the Pentarchy of Blood was established by the High Lords of Terra to administer judgment. Five Chapters—the Carcharodons, Charnel Guard, Death Eagles, Flesh Eaters, and Red Talons—were tasked with the systematic destruction of eleven Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes deemed Traitoris Perdita, laying waste to their homeworlds and ultimately bringing an end to this eight-decade-long conflict.

7th Black Crusade (811.M37)
One of the infamous Black Crusades led by the notorious Warmaster of Chaos, Abaddon the Despoiler, launched from the Eye of Terror, the 7th Black Crusade occurred in 811.M37. The Blood Angels faced Abaddon’s forces at Midian, where he unleashed a relentless assault against them, leading Khornate Berserkers into the heart of their defenses. Despite the Blood Angels' efforts, they could not reclaim the fallen. An obscure reference indicates that an unidentified Space Marine Chapter of mysterious origin intervened, as chronicled in The Canticle of Cassandria Lev - Vol. CVI. This account describes a "grey-clad" Chapter emerging from "The outer night" to support the Imperium, whose ships ambushed Abaddon’s forces following the Blood Angels' defeat, providing them with critical respite. Visual depictions of these events can be found on the crypt-world of Hypasitis, where murals show these Space Marines with their features obscured by black obsidian disks. Given the elusive history of the Carcharodons, any understanding of their actions must rely on fragmented records and historical incidents that hint at their involvement. This significant engagement is classified by Imperial scholars as a “[Special] Probable Encounter/Recorded Sighting” of the infamous Chapter.

Angevin Crusade (322-384.M39)
During the Angevin Crusade, which led to the conquest of the Calyx Expanse and the eventual establishment of the Calixis Sector, Rogue Trader Basil Horothis commanded his ship, the Stark Venger, along with a significant force of naval armsmen against the Drukhari pirates on the perpetual night world of Loth. However, Horothis quickly realized that his forces were diminished amid the fierce combat on this treacherous planet. Under the swirling clouds and sporadic lightning, his armsmen faced brutal hit-and-run assaults from the Kabal of Shadowed Thorns. Just as Horothis began to plan a retreat from Loth, the Kabal launched a sudden strike against the Stark Venger, crippling the Cruiser's main drives and forcing it out of low orbit.

Horothis, testing his skills as a ship handler, attempted a perilous landing. The landing proved difficult, and only through the expertise of Horothis and his master helmsman, Orgef Keel, did the Venger manage to survive at all. Unfortunately, this landing put them in a dire situation. Trapped within their stranded vessel, Horothis and his crew were quickly encircled by the Drukhari, who launched random attacks to kill and capture slaves. All Horothis could do was send an astropathic distress call for help and use the ship's weapons to fend off the xenos pirates.

After a month of relentless siege, the Venger's ammunition was nearly depleted, and many crew members had been taken. The Kabal of Shadowed Thorns became emboldened and initiated a sustained assault on the downed Cruiser. As the fighting reached the bridge, Horothis and his retainers battled fiercely against the agile Wych gladiators. Just when their situation seemed dire, two bolts of bruise-colored lightning cleaved through the Wych ranks, killing some and scattering the others. From the chaos emerged two hulking figures clad in gray, emanating frost and the scent of ozone. Without hesitation, these two Space Marine Terminators engaged the Wyches with their hissing Lightning Claws, swiftly turning the tide of battle. Within moments, the decks were slick with blood, and the remaining Wyches fled in panic.

This pattern repeated throughout the ship, with survivors reporting the sudden appearance of numerous Assault Terminators—though there were likely no more than a dozen—who descended upon the enemy with ruthless efficiency. The Drukhari, overwhelmed by the ferocity of the counterattack, retreated from the Venger. Meanwhile, Thunderhawks unleashed a battalion of gray-clad warriors equipped with bolters and blades onto the shadowy plains outside the wrecked ship. As confusion and rage swept through the Drukhari ranks, they charged the Space Marines, who stood resolutely in loose formation, not firing a shot even as dark energy beams crackled overhead.

Just as the fastest Scourges neared the Space Marines, the Emperor's Chosen executed their trap. For the first time in eons, the surface of Loth was illuminated by searing lance beams that reduced the ground around the Venger to boiling lava, incinerating the Drukhari. Only then did the Space Marines spring into action, pursuing the remaining survivors until they fled back to their Webway gates.

In the aftermath, Horothis spoke briefly with the commander of the Space Marines, describing him as deathly pale, with blank black eyes and sharp teeth. The Astartes communicated solely in ancient High Gothic, informing Horothis that reinforcements were en route and requesting a tithe of war supplies from the Venger's hold. He declined to reveal his identity or that of his men, departing three solar days before the Imperial Navy outriders arrived. Only after Inquisitorial representatives questioned Horothis, now occupied with establishing his estates on Loth, did they realize that these Space Marines belonged to no Chapter associated with the Crusade, drawing connections to ancient myths of a long-forgotten Chapter.

Against the Orks (211.M41)
Unexpectedly, the Carcharodons assisted an Adeptus Mechanicus Explorator fleet in repelling an assault from a fleet of Ork Terror Ships.

Battle of Zartak (circa 800s.M41)
On the Imperial prison world of Zartak, a warband of Night Lords, along with their daemonic allies, descended to harvest the planet's population. The Imperial personnel and local Arbitrators were quickly overwhelmed and slaughtered by the insidious Traitors. However, the Carcharodons also targeted Zartak for their latest Red Tithe. A brutal battle erupted in the shadows of the underground prison, where the two factions tested their skills against one another. Corridors and mine shafts ran red with blood as the Night Lords were gradually cornered. The climactic battle took place in the prison's primary geothermal sink shaft, where the Night Lords’ leader was slain, and a daemonic ritual was narrowly thwarted by the Carcharodons' Chief Librarian, Te Kahurangi. The remaining Night Lords retreated swiftly, and with the Traitors dealt with, the Carcharodons began their tithe. Within days, the only survivor to tell the tale was a single traumatized and blood-soaked Arbitrator, surrounded by countless corpses.

War in the Deeps (circa 800s.M41)
As the Tyranid Hive Fleets were inexorably drawn to the light of the Astronomican, the Carcharodons engaged in a protracted war of attrition against the relentless spawn of the Great Devourer on the galaxy’s periphery. Unlike previous Tyranid incursions from the Eastern Fringe, this time they attacked from beneath the galactic plane, targeting the vulnerable areas of the Imperium. Despite the Carcharodons' success in annihilating numerous splinter fleets, even Tyberos, the Chapter's leader, recognized that their actions were merely a temporary measure against the looming threat of Hive Fleet Leviathan.

The Devourer Denied (circa 800s.M41)
The Cult of the Star Saints represented a vast Genestealer Cult infestation that had infiltrated all levels of society on the Shrine World of Piety V. Their potent psychic signal began to attract a Tyranid Hive Fleet from below the galactic plane, placing Tyberos and his Chapter on the brink of extinction. In desperation, the Carcharodons appealed for aid from a Renegade Astartes Chapter known as the Ashen Claws. Meanwhile, the 3rd Company, led by Captain Bail Sharr, was dispatched to Piety V to eradicate the infestation. Tyberos hoped that neutralizing the Genestealer Patriarch would disrupt the advancing swarm.

Provoking the cult into a general uprising, the Carcharodons fought through thousands of cultists, but their sheer numbers soon overwhelmed them, forcing a last stand inside Piety V's primary Imperial Cathedral. This was part of their plan, as Bail Sharr unleashed his Terminator Squads and an ancient Contemptor Pattern Dreadnought that cut through the chaotic mutants. The bloodshed drew the Patriarch into the open, where it was obliterated by a 3rd Company Librarian. The death of their leader sent the remaining cultists into disarray, and they broke upon the unyielding ceramite armor of the Carcharodons.

The decisive blow came with the arrival of Ashen Claws reinforcements. Within hours, the Cult of the Star Saints was ground down and forced to retreat. The sudden cessation of the psychic beacon caused the nearby Hive Fleet to hesitate and retreat back into the void beneath the galaxy, sparing the Carcharodons from extinction, albeit temporarily. When an Imperial retribution force arrived weeks later, they found Piety V in ruins, setting about to eliminate the few surviving Genestealers. The Imperium never learned the full extent of the Carcharodons' sacrifices or the unspeakable horrors they had helped to avert.

Badab War (910-913.M41)
The Carcharodons' Chapter fleet made a sudden and alarming appearance in the Maelstrom Zone in 910.M41, causing concern among both Loyalist and Secessionist forces. They arrived aboard an unidentified, fire-scorched Space Marine strike cruiser that proclaimed its presence using ancient but still valid Imperial authorization protocols. Claiming to have come in response to a summons from Terra, they identified themselves as the "Carcharodons Astra" (or "Space Sharks" in Low Gothic) and sought permission from the Loyalists to engage in battle against the Secessionists.

Upon their arrival, Tyberos, the Force Commander of the Carcharodons, presented the Inquisitor Legate overseeing the Badab conflict with Notices Patent affirming their rights from several deceased High Lords of Terra and Inquisitors. Tyberos even underwent psychic probing and gene-sampling to demonstrate his loyalty. The Inquisitor Legate vouched for the Carcharodons, and Lord High Commander Carab Culln of the Red Scorpions reluctantly accepted them into his command, albeit with lingering doubts regarding their loyalties and deviations from the Codex Astartes during their extensive travels beyond Imperial space.

Initially, the Carcharodons were deployed to the Endymion Cluster, a territory governed by the Secessionist Mantis Warriors Chapter, instead of the Badab Sector. They methodically targeted planets harboring the Mantis Warriors, forcing the Chapter to abandon their hit-and-run tactics in favor of a defensive posture, thereby avoiding direct engagements in areas where the Secessionists had local support.

During the final battle of the Badab War in 913.M41 on Badab Primaris, homeworld of the Renegade Astral Claws Chapter and Lufgt Huron, the Tyrant of Badab, the Carcharodons sabotaged critical atomic and geothermal reactors powering the hive cities. This resulted in catastrophic tectonic upheaval, leading to the collapse of entire hive sectors into massive chasms filled with molten lava.

Following the fall of Badab Primaris, the remaining Secessionists—comprising members of the Astral Claws, Executioners, Mantis Warriors, and Lamenters Chapters—were put on trial before a specially convened Consistorial Court. Before leaving the Maelstrom Zone, the Carcharodons returned to the Endymion Cluster, where they, in cooperation with the Fire Hawks, struck at the Tranquility System. There, they harvested an entire generation of recruits to replenish their losses, forcing them to fight to the death to prove their worth as Carcharodons neophytes.

With their blood debt paid, the Carcharodons departed, marking their last known sighting via an Explorator augury beacon as they navigated through the Warp. Their current whereabouts and activities remain a mystery. The disappearance of the Fire Hawks during their Warp travel eventually allowed the Mantis Warriors to return to their ancestral domains once their penitent crusade concluded.

The Corcyran Massacre (910.M41)
The event known as the Corcyran Massacre was uncovered by an Imperial Navy patrol in 910.M41. They stumbled upon the wreckage of a smuggler’s base on the desolate world of Corcyra II, revealing a horrific scene of carnage. A brutal battle had taken place between two sub-company-sized forces of Space Marines from the Executioners and Carcharodons Chapters. Both Chapters, infamous for their brutality, had fought each other to mutual annihilation.

The remains of the base showed signs of a fierce struggle, with many bodies exhibiting horrific wounds—severed limbs and devastating trauma that would have felled even an Astartes. Some corpses were found locked in grim embraces, striking at their foes with their last vestiges of strength. It remains unknown which Chapter's last warrior emerged to claim a bitter victory, as neither Chapter has acknowledged any survivors from the massacre at Corcyra II.

Indomitus Crusade (Unknown Date.M42)
During the Indomitus Crusade, Budor V, home to the Imperial Castellus Sanctic citadel, fell to a force of Heretic Astartes from the Word Bearers. The Traitors successfully repelled multiple sieges from elements of the crusade's Fleet Secundus, Battlegroup Betaris. When the Traitors' diabolists began summoning Daemons, they were eliminated by a sudden strike from Carcharodons Astartes led by Company Master Mannfor. His strike cruiser, Ma-tahe, had allied itself with Fleet Secundus, allowing for strategic strikes from the void at the command of the company master.
 

The Shade Lord is a formidable and enigmatic figure within the Carcharodons Chapter of Space Marines, representing their unique blend of ferocity and mystery. This character often acts as a leader during the Carcharodons' brutal campaigns, embodying the Chapter's predatory nature. The Shade Lord is typically depicted in dark, fearsome armor that is both functional and intimidating, enhancing his presence on the battlefield. His reputation for ruthlessness is matched by his tactical acumen, making him a vital asset in the Carcharodons' relentless pursuit of their enemies.
